e-MERLIN pipeline and associated files.

v0.9 - released 20161003, contains many updates (described in eMERLIN_pipeline.py)
v0.7 - first public release of the pipeline, as described in Argo 2015.

Quickstart:
Download all files to wherever your data are located.
Edit "doall.inputs" to modify the parameters for your requirements.
At the command line, type the following and answer the prompts:
	> ParselTongue eMERLIN_pipeline.py doall.inputs
Have a cup of tea while you wait for it to run.

Various stages generate diagnostic plots and/or tables attached to your dataset.
Unless you are *sure* of your data quality and know what you are doing, we 
strongly recommend that you run the pipeline one stage at a time and look at 
these plots/tables after each section has completed, making any adjustments as 
required.  You WILL want to edit your solution tables.

More detailed instructions and recommendations can be found in the e-MERLIN 
user guide, available from here: http://www.e-merlin.ac.uk/data_red/
